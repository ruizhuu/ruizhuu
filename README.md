## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a systems design engineering student at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I was previously based in Jakarta for the FINCAPES project as a socio-economic monitoring intern, where I designed data pipelines and analyzed socioeconomic data for mangrove restoration.

I'm excited about extracting insights from complex data, whether that's financial, athletics, environmental, or socioeconomic. 

Some of my hobbies include:
- Basketball
- Language learning
