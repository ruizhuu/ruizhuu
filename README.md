## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a systems design engineering student at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I'm currently based in Jakarta for the FINCAPES project as a socio-economic monitoring intern. 

I'm interested in using data science towards economic development or climate change goals. I'm a systems thinker, and see data as one way to uncover new insights. 

I'm currently learning more about:
- Cybernetics<br>
- Political Economy<br>
- Photography and Videography
